VPC Peering:
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that 
enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. 
Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network

> VPC Peering works on "Same region" / "Different region" / "Different Account"

Note: VPC CIDR Block must be different

Here i'm taking two VPCs 
  1. VPC1 > 10.1.0.0/16
  2. VPC2 > 10.2.0.0/16

Step 1: 
  > Go to VPC Peering (EC2 > Peering Connections) 

Step 2:
  > Give the Proper Name in the section 'Peering connection name tag'

Step 3:

Step 4:
  > In this step select Same Account/Different Account and Same Region/Different Region.

Step 5:
  > Now Select the VPC Accepter (TO) (VPC2)

Step 6:
  > Now goto the Accepter Account And Accept the Peering Connection (Select Peering Connection And Click On 'Actions' Accept Request)

Step 7:
  > Now go the VPC1 Route table  add Route VPC2 CIDR Block address (10.2.0.0/16) and select Target Column 'Peering Connection ID'.
